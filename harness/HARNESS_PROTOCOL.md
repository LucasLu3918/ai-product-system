# Global Agent Harness Protocol

AIPS Global Harness makes AIPS available to supported Agent runtimes while preserving the user's existing Agent ecosystem.

## Turn-aware flow

~~~text
User Prompt
→ runtime-native Turn/Context mechanism
→ compact AIPS Turn Context
→ runtime + project instructions
→ relevant Project Intelligence
→ AIPS orchestration when applicable
→ execution / verification / targeted refresh
~~~

Every turn may resolve current context. Every turn must not rescan the repository.

## Non-invasive invariant

AIPS does not replace or delete user-owned Agent instructions, Skills, project source or unrelated runtime settings.

Shared instruction files use reversible delimited managed blocks. Structured settings files receive only an AIPS namespaced hook entry.

## Capability

Report TURN_NATIVE / CONTEXT_ALWAYS / SESSION_ONLY / MANUAL / UNSUPPORTED separately from installation status.

## Project persistence

ATTACHED projects use `.ai/intelligence/`. EPHEMERAL projects remain source-clean but may reuse external Intelligence at `~/.config/aips/projects/<project-id>/intelligence/`.

## Context budget

Load minimal Harness rules, critical native/project instructions, task-relevant Intelligence, then optional evidence on demand.

## Mutation safety

Existing-project mutations require current enough Intelligence, relevant native rules, Change Impact, valid project-native style preservation, and verification of declared inputs/outputs/data/events/consumers.

Missing required context fails closed for the affected mutation; general conversation fails soft.

## Uninstall

Remove only AIPS managed blocks/hooks/extensions. Preserve modified managed content with conflict warning. Preserve Project Intelligence cache unless the user explicitly requests cache removal.
